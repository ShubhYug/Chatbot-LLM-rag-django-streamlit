Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation using `uvloop` and `httptools`, used to serve FastAPI and other ASGI applications in production.

Gunicorn is a WSGI server for Python web applications. While Uvicorn handles async ASGI apps, Gunicorn is often used with synchronous frameworks like Django or Flask for scalable deployment.

Jinja2 is a templating engine for Python, often used with Flask and FastAPI for generating HTML content. It supports template inheritance, loops, conditions, and custom filters.

HTMX is a JavaScript library that allows developers to build dynamic web applications with server-side logic. It can make HTML more interactive without writing a single line of JavaScript by using `hx-*` attributes.

JWT JSON Web Tokens is a standard for securely transmitting information as a JSON object. It is commonly used in web applications for stateless authentication and session management.

Redis is an in-memory key-value store known for its speed. It's commonly used for caching, real-time analytics, message brokering (e.g., with Celery), and storing sessions in web applications.

Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue used to run time-consuming tasks in the background, such as sending emails or processing large data sets. It integrates well with Django, Flask, and FastAPI.

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications with all their dependencies into containers. This ensures consistency across environments and simplifies deployment.
